The website is based on a react-boilerplate template. The same structure and the its all written in Typescript. Please make sure you understand what you're doing before editing anything and It 100% works for production, check the compiled version before submitting anything. Got it?

## :warning: Few things to put in mind:
1. The region switch(Radio button) sections is named LanguageSwitch in the source code since it belonged to the old template. We need to switch it over before editing the imported content.

2. The logos in the features section will remain the same. Change&Remove the redux logo only :warning:

## :fire: You have a feature in mind?
You can help us out in the issues section putting the label `feature`
